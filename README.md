We are currently developing **The Agentic Project** â€” a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to integrate with a wide range of AI API providers.

The Agentic Project will be capable of executing actions both locally on your system and in the cloud. Its functionalities include, but are not limited to: executing shell commands, reading and editing files, making API requests, and much more.

The project is not publicly available yet, and we do not have a confirmed release date at this time.
This page will be updated as soon as more information becomes available.
